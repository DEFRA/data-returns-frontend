    <p>You must give a date, but time is optional. If you're giving time then you can use a T or a space between date and time.</p>
    <p>You must use dashes or slashes between numbers. Format the date as YYYY-MM-DD but only use dashes. You can also use DD-MM-YYYY (or DD/MM/YYYY).</p>
    <p>Format time as hh:mm:ss using the 24 hour clock.</p>
    <p>If you are using spreadsheet software it may change dates so they are in the wrong format. Fix this by setting the spreadsheet cell format to 'text'.</p>
    <p>You cannot give a date in the future. Check that you’ve submitted the correct date.</p>
